topic: "Transparency in Hardware Security: Challenges and Solutions <br> 
    The number of publicly disclosed hardware vulnerabilities continues to grow YoY according to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Many hardware organizations often struggle to improve their security because the highly proprietary nature of semiconductor designs prevents an open dialog about security. This often leads to custom solutions being developed and common mistakes being introduced that can lead to security vulnerabilities, many of which are not disclosed publicly. This presentation will discuss some of these challenges and the open solutions available for the semiconductor industry to collectively understand how to build secure hardware."
